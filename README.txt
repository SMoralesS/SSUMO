In this repository are the files of a web app prototype created for the Apithon-Bancolombia 2019 in Medell√≠n.
There are 2 HTML files: hola1.html is a page to include the google maps api(you have to change the key for your own) and in the index.html file is the rest of the page.
There is, also 1 CSS folder (assets), with the style of the page and 1 image folder.
